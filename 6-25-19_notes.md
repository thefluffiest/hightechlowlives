## ❇️:  next mission
* originally: shogunate has high class weaponry and blackuza wants to know  where they are getting this stuff from (and probably what they have)
* ✳️ **revised to:** why is the government working with the shogunate and supplying them with high caliber weapons?
    * ➡️ **find out why the government is working with the shogunate**
    * ➡️ **find out what their plans are**
    * not necessary but if an opportunity arises to mess their shit up, throw a wrench in their plan etc - we should do it. but first priority is information gathering.
* be discreet (we’ll will have aliases courtesy of the superboss)
* documents we grabbed have the Empire of Japan letterhead which implies that the government is helping the shogunate
    * documents are all shipping manifests
    * shared documents with odasakagawa
    * 👤 all shipping manifests are for **kyle drayton** from a guy named nobunaga (the governor/daimyo of the space station)
* 👤 superboss says that the creepy guy we fought in the hotel (who had the rocket staff/rocket spear and was out for blood) is named **Dazai** and the boss does not think highly of him or his dumb weapon.
  * he ran away before we could kill him so we might see him again and he will probably recognize us
